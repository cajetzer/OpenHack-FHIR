## Validate data loaded into FHIR Server using Postman
1. Open Postman
2. Go to the Workspace created in Challenge1
3. Go to Environment and find the **{azureapiforfhirname}proxy** environment created in Challenge2
4. Select the **AuthorizationGetToken** call from the **FHIR Calls-Sample** collection 
7. Select the **{azureapiforfhirname}proxy** postman environment in the top-right drop-down. 
8. Click Send you should receive a valid token, this will be automatically set in the bearerToken variable for the environment
9. Select the **List Patients** call from the **FHIR Calls-Samples** collection
10. Click Send and you should receive patients that you uploaded into the Storage Account that are now loaded into the FHIR Server.
Note: After token expiry, use the **AuthorizationGetToken** call to get another token

## Validate data loaded into FHIR Server and Synced into Dataverse
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/)
2. From the upper-right corner, select the environment where you deployed the FHIR Sync Agent.
3. In the left navigation pane, select Apps, and then select Healthcare Administration app.
