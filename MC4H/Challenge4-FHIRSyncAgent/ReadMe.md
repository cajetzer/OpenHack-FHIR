# Challenge4 - FHIR Sync Agent

FHIR-SyncAgent sychronizes health data between Azure API for FHIR and Dataverse' Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare securely and seemlessly. Applications built on the Dynamics platform (which includes Dynamics Model applications) that uses Dataverse can operate without the need to make REST API calls directly against Azure API for FHIR.
